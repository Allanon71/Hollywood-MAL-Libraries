# HGUI : CTEXT OBJECT



## INTRODUCTION
An **CText Object** is an internal structure used to store and draw text, it is associated with an **Area Object** to define where the text should be rendered.


## WHAT IS A CTEXT OBJECT?

**CText** stands for Custom Text an itâ€™s an object used to represent and draw text using several effects. A **CText object** is a building block of any gadget but can be used freely by the programmer for its own purposes or to build custom gadgets.

## CTEXT OBJECT STRUCTURE
Below there is the Area Object structure with its default values.

## CTEXT OBJECT METHODS

Here is a list of the available methods to manage the **CText objects**.
```plaintext
CTextObj = HGui.CText:New(options)
CTextObj:Free()
CTextObj:Render()
CTextObj:Set(options, object, offset)
```

#### HGui.CText:New(options)
Creates a new CText object with the given options, this object is tied to an Area object that you can specify or not, in the second case a new Area object will be created for you. Returns the created CText object.
All fields are optional.

```plaintext
INPUT
 options                A table with the the required options, basically it follow the structure

     right              Right margin in pixels
   window               The window this CText belongs to, can be the window's name or a window object,
                        if not specified the area will be linked to the currently active window.
   area                 An HGui.Area object where the CText will be rendered. You can specify an
                        existing Area object or a new one will be built for you. You have to specify
                        in the options the <position> table nad the <size> table to allow the system
                        to build the HGui.Area for you. <position> must have the <x> and <y> fields,
                        and <size> must have the <w> and <h> fields.
OUTPUT
 CTextObject            The created object
