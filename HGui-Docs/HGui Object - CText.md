# HGUI : CTEXT OBJECT



## INTRODUCTION
An **CText Object** is an internal structure used to store and draw text, it is associated with an **Area Object** to define where the text should be rendered.


## WHAT IS A CTEXT OBJECT?

**CText** stands for Custom Text an itâ€™s an object used to represent and draw text using several effects. A **CText object** is a building block of any gadget but can be used freely by the programmer for its own purposes or to build custom gadgets.

## CTEXT OBJECT STRUCTURE
Below there is the Area Object structure with its default values.

                        existing Area object or a new one will be built for you. You have to specify
                        in the options the <position> table nad the <size> table to allow the system
                        to build the HGui.Area for you. <position> must have the <x> and <y> fields,
                        and <size> must have the <w> and <h> fields.
OUTPUT
 CTextObject            The created object

*** CONTINUARE DA QUA ***


#### AreaObj:Free()
Free the AreaObj and its associated resources.

```plaintext
INPUT
 

OUTPUT
 result                 TRUE if the Area object was successfully free

EXAMPLE
-------
; Let's create a new Area object
Local myArea = HGui.Area:new(
     { position = { x = 10, y = 10 }, 
       size = { w = 100, h = 40 }, 
       active = True, 
       events = { onmousedown = Function() DebugPrint("HELLO!") EndFunction}
       },
     Nil, 
     Nil) 

; Free the created Area
myArea:Free()
```

#### AreaObj:Render()
Renders the AreaObj in the window it belogs applying the given skin if any.

```plaintext
INPUT


OUTPUT
 result                 TRUE if the Area was rendered without errors.

EXAMPLE
-------
; Create an Area object
Local myArea = HGui.Area:new(
     { position = { x = 10, y = 10 }, 
       size = { w = 100, h = 40 }, 
       active = True, 
       events = { onmousedown = Function() DebugPrint("HELLO!") EndFunction}
       },
     Nil, 
     Nil) 

; Render it
myArea:Render()
```

#### AreaObj:Set(options, object, offset)
Modify the Area object with the given **options** which can be any of the Area structure fields plus some more fields specified below. 
Object is used to change the linked parent object, while offset is to move the Area specifying coordinate offsets.

```plaintext
INPUT
 options                You have to pass a table here with all the structure fields you want to
                       modify, here is a list of supported arguments:
   recurse              True to recursively modify all parent object childs objects.
   position             A table with the new area position (absolute)
   x                    Horizontal position
   y                    Vertical position
   size                 A table with the new area size
   w                    Area width
   h                    Area height
   skin                 A table with the skin definition
   active               TRUE let the Area to react to events
   events               A table with the events to respond to (see the :new() method for more details).
     onMouseOver        Callback function
     onMouseOut         Callback function
     onMouseDown        Callback function
     onMouseUp          Callback function
     onRightMouseUp     Callback function
 object                 Parent object
 offset                 A table with the relative offsets
   x                    Horizontal offset
   y                    Vertical offset

OUTPUT
 result                 TRUE if there was no errors.

EXAMPLE
-------
; Create an Area object
Local myArea = HGui.Area:new(
     { position = { x = 10, y = 10 }, 
       size = { w = 100, h = 40 }, 
       active = True, 
       events = { onmousedown = Function() DebugPrint("HELLO!") EndFunction}
       },
     Nil, 
     Nil) 

; Move the area changing the horizontal coordinate adding 100 pixels
myArea:Set(
  { position =
    { x = 100 }
    })
```

## AREA OBJECT FUNCTIONS
There are also some utility functions suited for several tasks:

#### HGui.Area_FindByName(area_name)
This function is used to find an Area by its name, the name that is stored in `AreaObj.private.name` field, and it returns the Area object and its index in the global **HGui.Areas** table where all defined areas are gathered.
Names are unique random strings assigned at creation time, you can redefine them or read the assigned value in the field `AreaObj.Private.Name`

```plaintext
INPUT
 area_name              Specify here the Area name you want to find.

OUTPUT
 AreaObj                FALSE if the object was not found, otherwise the Area object will be
                        returned.
 AreaIndex              If the Area object was found its index in the global HGui.Areas table
                        will be also returned.

EXAMPLE
-------
; Create an Area object
Local myArea = HGui.Area:new(
     { position = { x = 10, y = 10 }, 
       size = { w = 100, h = 40 }, 
       active = True, 
       events = { onmousedown = Function() DebugPrint("HELLO!") EndFunction}
       },
     Nil, 
     Nil) 

; Retrieve the area name
Local areaName = myArea.Private.Name

; Retrieve the Area object & Index
Local foundObject, foundIndex = HGui.Area_FindByName(areaName)
```
The above example  is not really useful but if you rename your areas overwriting the `myArea.private.name` field for your own purposes you could find this function useful, the important thing is to have unique names!
