# HOLLYWOOD-MAL Libraries
**This is a collection of libraries I coded to help myself with my projects**

# IMPORTANT NOTE
From now (04/08/2020) I'm putting libraries using a global include file called **+Includes.hws** where all library names are defined along with their path, in order to run the examples you need to setup the variable **#INC_PATH** with the absolute path where you have saved/cloned the libraries, if you do this you will be able to run all the examples with a double click, for example let's suppose you have cloned the entire repository into the following path : `C:/MyHollywoodStuff/Libs/`  
All you have to do is:  
+ Open the file `+Includes.hws`  
+ Edit the line `Const #INC_PATH     = ""`  
+ Putting the absolute location, in our case `C:/MyHollywoodStuff/Libs/`  
+ Save the edited file  
+ You are ready!
